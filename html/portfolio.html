                <p>This page won't contain things like reference sheets. Those can be found on the <a href="characters.html">characters</a> page. Hovering over the bar on the left will reveal a table of contents for an easier time getting to different sections.</p>
                <p>Some images on this page are scrollable horizontally. Additionally, most of the text accompanying images is also scrollable but vertically. Speaking of scrolling, the section with the table of contents works pretty well if you're struggling with scrolling.</p>
