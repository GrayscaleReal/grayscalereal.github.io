Refunds are acceptable in most cases for the first 24 hours, or until the first major phase is completed (major phases being a finalized sketch for artwork, or the finalized blockout for Figura avatars). Refunds after that point will only be 90% of what was paid. I will keep the other 10%.</li>
                    <li>All rights to the product produced belong to the me. You <b style="font-style: oblique; text-decoration: underline;">are not</b> permitted to use my works for commercial purposes, feed them into AI, or use them in any AI-related services. You <b style="font-style: oblique; text-decoration: underline;">are</b> permitted to use it for any other personal purposes. Permission for commerical rights to the artwork are negotiable, and will be an additional cost. Permission for using the art to train GenAI models or for use in AI-related services are non-negotiable.</li>
                    <li>The listed prices account for the base prices. Depending on the complexity of the commission, the price may increase. I reserve the right to decline a commission if I feel it would be outside of what I'm comfortable doing skill-wise or contains subjects I refuse to partake in the creation of.</li>
                    <li>You are free to ask for updates whenever you please. I give updates during major phases. Alterations to the product during these stages is acceptable, provided it isn't a drastic change.</li>
                    <li>References are preferably to be provided by you. This is to ensure the final product is as accurate as I'm able to make it, rather than needing to go off of vague descriptions. In certain scenarios, and if requested prior, I'd be willing to go with full artistic freedom based on a loose description if desired.</li>
                    <li>Please be polite. Remember, I'm a person too. I will attempt to be as transparent as I can with everything, but there are times where I'm unable to communicate.</li>
