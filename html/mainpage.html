        Hi! I'm Gray. I'm also another one of those weird fluffy cat furry things.
        <br>
        When not playing games, I usually spend my free time coding for FNF mods (using primarily Psych Engine 0.6.3). 
        I also compose. Usually it's for my own mods, however sometimes I compose for non-mod related purposes.
